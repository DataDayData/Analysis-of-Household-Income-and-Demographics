#f. Create a scatter plot showing the effect education has on log_income. Do you see any linear relationship between the two variables?
ggplot(houshold_data,aes(x= education, y=log_income)) +geom_point(alpha=0.2) +labs(x="Education",y="Log_Income",title="Scaterrplot Log_Income vs Education")
#g. Analyze a detailed summary of a linear regression model between log_income and education. What is the R-squared value? Is the model a good fit? Is it better than the previous model?
linearMod2 <- lm(log_income ~ education, houshold_data)
summary(linearMod2)
#h. Analyze a detailed summary of a linear regression model between the dependent variable log_income, and the independent variables age, education, and employment. Is this model a good fit? Why? What conclusions can be made about the different independent variables?
linearMod3 <- lm(log_income ~ education + age + employment, houshold_data)

#j. Create a graph that contains a y = x line and uses the multiple regression model to plot the predicted data points against the actual data points of the training set.
ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x= houshold_data$log_income, y=fitted(linearMod3)), alpha=0.5) + geom_line(aes(x=houshold_data$log_income, y= houshold_data$log_income), col = 'yellow') +labs(x="Actual income", y="Predicted income")
