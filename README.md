# Analysis-of-Household-Income-and-Demographics
This code analyzes the relationship between household income and demographic variables, including age, education, and employment. The analysis involves data preprocessing, such as removing duplicate rows and outliers, and creating a new variable by taking the log of a column. The code also renames columns, creates scatter plots, calculates correlations, and performs linear regression models with different independent and dependent variables.
